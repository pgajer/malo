/**
 * @brief Samples from the uniform distribution over (K-1)-dimensional simplex.
 *
 * This function generates a random array of K non-negative doubles that sum up to 1,
 * effectively sampling a point from the (K-1)-dimensional simplex. It uses the
 * "ordered differences" method to ensure uniform distribution over the simplex.
 *
 * @details The algorithm works as follows:
 * 1. Generate K-1 uniform random numbers between 0 and 1.
 * 2. Sort these numbers in ascending order.
 * 3. Calculate the differences between adjacent pairs of these sorted numbers,
 *    including 0 as the lower bound and 1 as the upper bound.
 * 4. These differences form the K components of the sampled point on the simplex.
 *
 * This method ensures that the resulting point is uniformly distributed over the simplex.
 *
 * @param rK Pointer to an integer specifying the dimension of the simplex plus one.
 *           The value pointed to by rK should be greater than 1.
 * @param[out] lambda Pointer to a pre-allocated array of doubles where the output will be stored.
 *                    This array should have at least K elements, where K is the value pointed to by rK.
 *
 * @pre The caller must ensure that:
 *      - rK is not NULL and points to a valid integer greater than 1.
 *      - lambda is not NULL and points to a pre-allocated array of at least K doubles.
 *
 * @post Upon return:
 *       - lambda[0] to lambda[K-1] will contain K non-negative doubles that sum to 1.
 *       - The random number generator state will be updated.
 *
 * @note This function uses R's random number generator functions (GetRNGstate and PutRNGstate).
 *       It is designed to be called from R via .Call() or similar interfaces.
 *
 * @Rf_warning This function does not perform input validation. Incorrect inputs may lead to
 *          undefined behavior.
 *
 * @see For background on the algorithm:
 *      Smith, R. L., & Tierney, L. (1996). Exact Transition Probabilities for the
 *      Independence Metropolis Sampler. Technical Report.
 *
 * @todo Evaluate numerical stability for very large K values.
